### treesitter
The goal of nvim-treesitter is both to provide a simple and easy way to use
the interface for tree-sitter in Neovim and to provide some
basic functionality such as highlighting based on it:

[Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental
parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for
a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as 
the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

General enough to parse any programming language
Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
Robust enough to provide useful results even in the
presence of syntax errors

Dependency-free so that the runtime library 
(which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any
application

### nvim ts-raibows -2
deprcicated!!!! use rainbow-delimiters in future!!!

### Tree-sitter text objects
this remains a mystery!!! but potentially game changing!!!
